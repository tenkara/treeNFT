# treeNFT

**Concept:**

Previous NFT Tree projects position in the space is as a way to plant trees and receive an NFT for the event like NFTREE and TreeRise. Other projects focus on pixelated trees on the blockchain like The Crypto Trees and NFTrees. Our take on creating Tree NFTs is creating a brand, similar to the missions and aesthetics of OnChain Monkeys, Fishy Fam, BAYC and Doodles. Trees are perfect for an NFT project of this type because they already come in so many variations depending on their species, lifecycle, preferred environment, location, and seasonality. With seasonality, time of day, and age of tree, we believe this is the perfect use case to make dynamic NFTs through the help of oracles.



**Work Flow:**

Users would follow this sort of workflow:
1.Enter the website and read a landing page about what the project is about
2.A button is displayed where they are able to mint a Tree NFT for .1 Eth
3.Connect to metamask to sign transaction
4.Users with their NFT then have access to another to modify their tree. Such as adding fertilizer to make the tree grow, pruning their tree, and adding water. 
5.Another metamask popup to sign and send transaction
6.The image of the NFT Tree changes depending on what function they chose.
